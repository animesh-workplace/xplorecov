# XploreCoV Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up both the backend and frontend of the XploreCoV application.

## Backend Setup

Follow these steps to set up the backend of the project:

### Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.11** must be installed on your system.
-   Install **Poetry** for dependency management.
-   Install **Micromamba** for workflow tools.

### Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**:

    - Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    - Install dependencies using Poetry:
        ```bash
        poetry install
        ```
    - Activate the Poetry environment:
        ```bash
        poetry shell
        ```

2. **Create a `.env` File**:

    - Inside the `backend` folder, create a file named `.env` with the following keys:
        ```env
        BASE_HOST=<your_base_host>
        BASE_PORT=<your_base_port>
        DEBUG=<true_or_false>
        BASE_URL=<your_base_url>
        BACKEND_WEBSOCKET_UUID=<uuid_placeholder>
        ```

3. **Apply Migrations**:

    - Run the following commands to set up the database:
        ```bash
        python manage.py makemigrations
        python manage.py migrate
        ```

4. **Create a Superuser**:

    - Create a superuser account:
        ```bash
        python manage.py createsuperuser
        ```

5. **Generate Backend UUID**:

    - Generate a UUID for the backend:
        ```bash
        python manage.py create_backend_uuid
        ```
    - Add the generated UUID to the `.env` file under `BACKEND_WEBSOCKET_UUID`.

6. **Install Workflow Tools**:

    - Run the following command to install the workflow tools:
        ```bash
        micromamba install -r .workflow-venv -n xplorecov
        ```

7. **Run Required Services**:

    - Start Redis:
        ```bash
        redis-server
        ```
        Ensure that logs are stored in the `backend/database` folder.
    - Start Celery:
        ```bash
        celery -A xplorecov_backend worker -l info -E
        ```
    - Start Gunicorn:
        ```bash
        gunicorn xplorecov_backend.asgi:application -c gunicorn.config.py
        ```

8. **Update Workflow Tools**:

    - Update tools and fetch resources by calling the API:
        ```
        xplorecov/api/job/run-tool-update-workflow/
        ```

9. **Folder Requirements**:
    - Ensure the following folders exist:
        - `datalake`
        - `database`
    - If these folders do not exist, create them before running any commands.

## Frontend Setup

Follow these steps to set up the frontend of the project:

### Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**:

    - Navigate to the frontend directory:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        ```
    - Install dependencies using Bun:
        ```bash
        bun install
        ```

2. **Create a `.env` File**:
    - Inside the `frontend` folder, create a file named `.env` with the following keys:
        ```env
        API_BASE_URL=<api_base_url>
        ROUTER_BASE=<router_base>
        ```

---

## Summary

-   Set up the backend by installing dependencies, creating a `.env` file, applying migrations, and running services.
-   Generate a backend UUID and include it in the `.env` file.
-   Start Redis, Celery, and Gunicorn services.
-   Set up the frontend by installing dependencies and configuring the `.env` file.

With everything set up, the application should be ready to run. Ensure all services and workflows are properly configured before starting the application.
